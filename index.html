    <p>Winston(Win), our friendly loving and cheeky Dogue de Bordeaux X Olde English Bulldogge has been part of our family since my daughter Millie-Anne turned 7.<br>He was a special gift she longed for and has been her best friend ever since.<br>He's the most loyal companion any person could have and is incredibly affectionate (just like a baby.)<br>His bewildering features catches the eye of the community everytime he is out walking and has done since he was a pup.<br>The soft streak of pure ice white fur that runs down his face, meeting the tip of his nose makes him divergent, independent and unique.
    <br>
    Winston's brother, the one and only Dre(Dremond) was picked up a few weeks after him, after him being torn between the two. Being the runt of the litter, Dre was always exquisite in his own special ways. He was definitely one of the most clumsiest, softest dogs we knew, but also the most doting and warm dog you could meet. <br> He is unfortuanately spoke about in past tense after sadly passing away in 2020. Old and frail, he never failed to make the family smile.<br>The two brothers together ran the house and were no doubt the best guard dogs, ensuring our safety at all times.
    Running through the fields, pouncing through the grass, play fighting and rolling around like they'd never been out before ws their most treasured activity throughout Dre's life and carries on in Winston.</p>
